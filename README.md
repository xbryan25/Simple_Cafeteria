# Simple_Cafeteria

## What this program is about
- This program is a mini project as well as a playing ground for me to get familiar with C. This program simulates a cafeteria, where you can choose what to buy based on the menu. It also has an admin mode, where the menu can be edited in several ways.


## Problems encountered
- This is my first time working with C in this scale. I didn't really know much about the syntax of C before I started this mini project. I encountered lots of problems, mainly because I haven't had a full grasp on the syntax of C yet. I also worked on this project on and off, which caused me to forget some of the problems that I have encountered. 
- Some of the problems that I have encountered that I still remember include not knowing how to read and write on a .csv file in c, not knowing how structs work, not knowing how pointers work, and not knowing how string padding in C works.
